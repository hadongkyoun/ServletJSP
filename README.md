# Ultimate goal : make Digital Diary Library
## So, what is it?

Record ur life story or values on ur digital book.

Then, the book is saved in ur bookcase.

If u check this book 'public', then people can see ur book content.

All people can see needed information. 

## Why need this?

If u find some information about food, restaurant, nutritional supplements, ur dreams in website, there are so many advertisement which is no objectivity.

But, this would be have objectivity.

This is not proper to advertise something and not goal to view.

This is close to private than public so that would be have objectivity.

Also, there is no need to advertise something.
